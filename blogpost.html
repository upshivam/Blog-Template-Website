            organizes content in the form of categories and posts. Posts on a blog are presented in reverse
            chronological order. That means your latest post goes to the top of the page. That way, when you make a new
            post, it will come first and the first post will go below it. Anyone can create a blog and then write on
            that blog. Bloggers (a word for people who write on blogs) often write about their opinions and thoughts. A
            blog containing video material is called a video blog or video log, usually shortened to vlog.</p>
